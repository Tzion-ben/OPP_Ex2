# The Maze of Waze:

This project is about create a data structure of a directional graph, that include vertices and edges that include vertices and edges that every one of them contain weights .
The weights are can be use for any thing that need for like : the time that take to go from node to node  or the cost to go from node to node and so on.

This project include another class' that is a class of Algorithems that works on diractional graph.
This class include some methods like: a method to check if specific graph is connected or not, a method to find the shortest path from source node to destantion node and so no.
